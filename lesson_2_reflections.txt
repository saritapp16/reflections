What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    I think that git is able to track the files in that directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    I think the staging area is a place between the working directory and the
    repository. When you upload your files to the SA, you´re saying to git
    that you´re about to commit those files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
    In the stating area, I´m able to compare my changes with the working
    directory to be sure I haven´t made more that one logical change in 
    the file I´m about to commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
    I think branches are useful when you´re working with people because 
    makes easier do big changes into a bunch of files.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
    Diagrams make easier for me to track a commit´s parent.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
    The result is a new commit that contains all the wanted changes of a file.
    We get the final version of the moment.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
    Pros:
	-Skip the tedious job, by automaticly adding changes that we most
        probably want in the final version.
    Cons:
       -We always have to be aware of the changes that somebody else does.
