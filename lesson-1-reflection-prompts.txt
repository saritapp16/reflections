How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can check the changes I made (a starting point where everything was working
    fine) and what did a I made to stop the code for working.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because I save time looking for little bugs or typos, just by comparing ç
    a working code with the one with the mistake. I also can check how my
    code has changed and compare old methods with new ones.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros of manually choosing a commit:
    -You know exactly what you want to save.
    -Maybe avoid to save unnecesary changes or usless commits.

    Cons of manually choosig when to create a commit:
    -Can forget or loose something important.
    -Can pass a long time before  you commit something. By then, lots of changes
    will be done and the commit will be huge.
    -Maybe save unrelated changes together.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Some version control systems allow us to save more than one file in one 
    commit because a change may affect two or more files related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use the command git log to view the all the commits that has been 
    done to a file, and the command diff to view the difference between two
    commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I´ll always be sure I can undo a mistake easily

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    From now on, when I start a project, I´m not going to manually save all 
    my changes in a disorganized folder, instead I´m going to properly save
    them in a repository.
